# Employee Management System

## Introduction

A light weight linux-compatible program written in C that runs in terminal to manage employees records supports very basic CRUD operations using normal file system (no databases).

- When starting the program you are provided 5 options:

1. Add employee record.
2. List all employees.
3. Modify an employee record.
4. Delete an employee record.
5. Exit

- Records are saved in a single file called "records.txt" located in EmployeeRecords/ directory.

- Each employee is assigned a unique 5 digits ID (Not guaranteed to be unique nor random as I used an unsophisticated random number generator function).

- Program is designed for educational/demonstrational purposes.
